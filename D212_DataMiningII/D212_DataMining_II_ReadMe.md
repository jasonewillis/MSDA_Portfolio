## Data Mining II Projects:

### Project I: 
**Research Question: From information about previous patients who were readmitted, can we predict which patients are likely to be readmitted in the future?**
- The goal of our analysis is to logically investigate the provided data set and, with evidence, support or reject the hypothesis.
   - Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types prior to processing.
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, any patient’s data correlate with potential readmission.

### Project II
**Research Question: From information about previous patients who were readmitted, can we ascertain the minimum number of principal variables for our patients?**
- The goal of our analysis is to logically investigate the provided data set and, by leveraging principal component analysis and other techniques, reduce the dimensionality of the provided dataset while keeping the model’s accuracy high.
