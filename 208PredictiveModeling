## Predictive Modeling Project (D208)
### Data Preparation and Cleaning for Hospital Readmissions Analysis
- The goal of our analysis is to investigate given data to support or reject the hypothesis. 
 -- Do the following three predictors: Initial Days, Readmissions, and Diabetes explain the variation in Total Charges?
- Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types in order to analyze and process. 
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, a patientâ€™s initial inpatient Multiple Regression for Predictive Modeling 4 days, age and the reason for their initial ad data correlate with the total charges incurred through
patient care.
