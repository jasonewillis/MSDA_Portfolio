## Data Cleaning Project (D206)
### Data Preparation and Cleaning for Hospital Readmissions Analysis
- Explored data, it's shape, index, data types, column counts, memory usage
- Deleted missing data and inspected rows/columns with NaNs
- Filled missing values w/Mean values
- Deleted redundant columns
- Used Boxplots to detect outliers
- Converted data types and renamed some column headers for consistant nomenclature
- Normalized data for PCA, created a Scree Plot and anotated points of intersection at 1.0
- Extracted PCA's to keep, displayed heat map and exported cleaned data.
