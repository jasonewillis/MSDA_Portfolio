## Capstone Project:

### Project: 
**Research Question: Is communication from a doctor more statistically significant to a patient’s overall hospital rating than a nurse?**
- Null hypothesis – Doctor communication does not have a more statistically significant impact on the overall hospital rating when compared to a nurse. 
- Alternate Hypothesis - Doctor communication has a more statistically significant impact on the overall hospital rating when compared to a nurse.
