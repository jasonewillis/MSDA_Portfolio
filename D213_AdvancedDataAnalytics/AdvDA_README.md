## Advanced Data Analytics Projects:

### Project I: 
**Research Question: Using the previous two years of data, are there any patterns present that can predict the revenue produced by the hospital for the next quarter?**
- The goal of our analysis is to leverage time series modeling techniques to forecast the daily revenue of our companyâ€™s next quarter.  
  - Then, to provide our pattern understandings, analysis and findings to company executives so they can understand readmission impacts in current times.

### Project II
**Research Question: Using historical product reviews, what effect will Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks have on the ability to accurately predict future consumer sentiment?**
- Using a combination of three sources of reviews, we are trying to use natural language processing pattern recognition to help understand and potentially predict consumer sentiment.  
  - By leveraging our data-driven recommendation model to predict customer sentiment, we can make more insightful suggestions to stakeholders.
