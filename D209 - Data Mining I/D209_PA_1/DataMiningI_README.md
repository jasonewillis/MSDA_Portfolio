## Data Mining I Projects:

### Project I: 
**Research Question: From information about previous patients who were readmitted, can we predict which patients are likely to be readmitted in the future?**
- The goal of our analysis is to investigate the provided data set and, with evidence, support or reject the hypothesis. 
  - Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types prior to processing. 
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, any patient’s data correlate with potential readmission.

### Project II
**Research Question: Given the medical dataset provided, can we classify (label) if a patient will be readmitted or not?**
- The goal of our analysis is to investigate the provided data set and, with evidence, support or reject the hypothesis. 
  - Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types prior to processing. 
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, any patient’s data correlate with potential readmission.
