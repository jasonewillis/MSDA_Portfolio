## Predictive Modeling Project (D208)
### Multiple Regression for Predictive Modeling
- The goal of the first course project analysis is to investigate given data to support or reject the hypothesis. 
  - Do the following three predictors: Initial Days, Readmissions, and Diabetes explain the variation in Total Charges?
- Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types in order to analyze and process. 
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, a patient’s initial inpatient days, age and the reason for their initial ad data correlate with the total charges incurred through patient care.

### Logistic Regression for Predictive Modeling
- The goal of the first course project analysis is to investigate given data to support or reject the hypothesis. 
  - Do the following three predictors: Initial Days, Initial Admin, and Diabetes have an influence on the probability of a patient’s readmission?
- Some data will need to be converted from categorical to numerical data types in order to analyze and process. 
- Our objective is to see how, if at all, a patient’s initial inpatient days, the reason for their initial admission or if they have diabetes correlate with their readmission within 30 days.
